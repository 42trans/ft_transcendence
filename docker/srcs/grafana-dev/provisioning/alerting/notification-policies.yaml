# List of notification policies
policies:
    - orgId: 1
      # <string> name of the contact point that should be used for this route
      receiver: hioikawa-discord
      # <list> The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example,
      #        multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would be batched into a single group.
      
      #        To aggregate by all possible labels use the special value '...' as the sole label name, for example:
      #        group_by: ['...']
      #        This effectively disables aggregation entirely, passing through all alerts as-is. This is unlikely to be what you want, unless you have a very low alert volume or your upstream notification system performs its own grouping.

        - grafana_folder
